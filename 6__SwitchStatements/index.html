    <!-- Switch statements -->
    <h1 class="title">Switch statements</h1>
    <div class="what">
        <em>Switch statements are your friend here — they take a single expression/value as an input, and then look
            through a number of choices until they find one that matches that value, executing the corresponding code
            that goes along with it. Here's some more pseudocode, to give you an idea</em>
    </div>

    <div class="theme">
        <ol>
            <li>The keyword <code>switch</code>, followed by a set of parentheses.</li>
            <li>An expression or value inside the parentheses.</li>
            <li>The keyword <code>case</code>, followed by a choice that the expression/value could be, followed by a
                colon.</li>
            <li>Some code to run if the choice matches the expression.</li>
            <li>A <code>break</code> statement, followed by a semi-colon. If the previous choice matches the
                expression/value, the browser stops executing the code block here, and moves on to any code that
                appears below the switch statement.</li>
            <li>As many other cases (bullets 3–5) as you like.</li>
            <li>The keyword <code>default</code>, followed by exactly the same code pattern as one of the cases
                (bullets 3–5), except that <code>default</code> does not have a choice after it, and you don't need to
                <code>break</code> statement as there is nothing to run after this in the block anyway. This is the
                default option that runs if none of the choices match.</li>
        </ol>
